    "Amadeus":
        "Winner of eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this 1984 biopic chronicles the life of Amadeus Mozart, namely through the eyes of his bitter contemporary, Antonio Salieri. Striving for authenticity, director Milos Forman shot the film using only natural light, arguably taking some cues from Stanley Kubrick, who did the same when making “Barry Lyndon.” Tom Hulce went above and beyond to prepare for his role as the famous composer. For instance, Hulce practiced piano for four to five hours a day before filming began.",
    "The Hurt Locker":
        "Kathryn Bigelow’s career hit a second stride with the release of her gripping Iraq War drama, “The Hurt Locker.” The film follows a bomb disposal team from one job to the next. Instead of traditional character development, the story coasts by on a wave of sustained and almost unbearable tension. It won a total of six Academy Awards, making Bigelow the first woman in history to win for Best Director.",
    "Mad Max: Fury Road":
        "Director George Miller resurrected his classic “Mad Max” franchise in 2015, with Tom Hardy taking on the lead role, formerly played by Mel Gibson. However, most fans would argue it's Charlize Theron's Furiosa who steals the show in this dazzling adventure movie, which sees her and Mad Max escaping the clutches of an evil warlord. As one might expect, the explosive action goes down in a post-apocalyptic wasteland inhabited by all sorts of depraved humans. The film took home six of the 10 Academy Awards for which it was nominated.",
    "The Truman Show":
        "A film that only gets more prescient with time, 1998's “The Truman Show” takes place in a completely fabricated town, where cameras lurk behind every corner and every citizen is an actor or actress. Every citizen, that is, except Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), the unwitting subject of a 24-hour reality show. As Truman catches on to the truth behind his existence, his cozy reality begins to collapse around him. Meanwhile, a megalomaniac named Christof (Ed Harris) pulls all the strings from above. Proving just how poignant the movie was and remains, a psychological condition known as the Truman Show Delusion has arisen in its wake. The film received three Oscar nominations, including for Best Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen.",
    "Finding Nemo":
        "Given Pixar's masterful grip on storytelling and computer animation alike, it's no surprise that the studio dominates when it comes to the best films of the 21st century. One of their most celebrated efforts is this 2003 adventure, in which a clownfish named Marlin navigates a perilous undersea terrain to find his missing son, Nemo. Until “The Incredibles 2” came along in 2018, this was Pixar's highest worldwide grossing film to date. The animated flick was so successful it spawned a spin-off sequel, “Finding Dory,” in June 2016.",
    "The Silence of the Lambs":
        "This 1991 crime drama wasn't the first to put Hannibal Lecter up on the big screen, but it was certainly the most impactful. Playing the iconic sadist to lizard-like perfection was actor Anthony Hopkins, who engages in a battle of wits with FBI Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) as he helps her track down a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The film was followed by a sequel, a prequel, a TV show, and even an 8-bit video game-style short film. What's more, it is one of the few films to win five Academy Awards in all the major categories including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",
    "The Circus":
        "Charlie Chaplin bridged slapstick comedy with tender melancholy in “The Circus.” Chaplin's role was as the “Little Tramp,” a drifter who gets hired as a clown when he accidentally runs into the middle of a circus performance while trying to evade police officers. As a clown, Little Tramp is only funny when he's not trying to be and suffers from an ill-fated infatuation with a bareback rider. The movie won an Academy Award at the first presentation ceremony of the awards in 1929 for “Versatility and genius in writing, acting, directing, and producing.” In spite of this achievement, the process of filming was the worst in Chaplin's career. He was in the process of divorcing Lita Grey as her lawyers dragged Chaplin's name through the mud and sought to acquire his studio assets, forcing an eight-month pause in production.",
    "Stagecoach":
        "“Stagecoach” goes down in history as the film featuring John Wayne in his breakthrough role as the Ringo Kid. The storyline follows a ragtag group of characters aboard the Overboard stagecoach en route from Arizona Territory to New Mexico while the threat of outlaws—or an Apache attack—waits around every bend. The film walked away with the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Thomas Mitchell and Best Music (Scoring).",
    "The Producers":
        "Putting show business in its crosshairs, this scathing satire follows two scheming producers as they plot the biggest Broadway flop of all time. The name of that flop is “Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden” and it’s every bit as offensive as one might expect. Even so, the film is regarded as a cult classic today. And what’s more, the movie earned Brooks his sole Academy Award, for Best Original Screenplay.",
    "Little Women":
        "Greta Gerwig’s sophomore directorial effort cemented her status as a veritable auteur, making her 2020 Oscars snub that much harder to swallow. Her take on Louisa May Alcott’s seminal novel is the last and arguably the best in a long line of big-screen adaptations. Actors Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, and Eliza Scanlen play the March sisters and lead a talented cast. At the British Academy Film Awards, however, the movie took home a win for Best Costume Design.",
    "Days of Heaven":
        "Set during the turn of the 20th century, “Days of Heaven” follows a romantic couple named Bill and Abby as they take up employment on a Texas farm where they pretend to be siblings. When it's discovered that the landowner has feelings for Abby, the couple try to exploit those feelings for personal gain. Featuring lush cinematography and sparse dialogue, the movie cemented director Terrence Malick's status as a visual maestro, albeit one of an elusive nature. True to his mysterious persona, Malick went on a 20-year hiatus after this film was released. The film was chosen for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2007.",
    "The Best Years of Our Lives":
        "In this harrowing 1946 drama, three soldiers return home after serving in World War II, and then struggle to reintegrate into society. It was directed by William Wyler, a former Air Force major whose previous war film, “Mrs. Miniver,” is held in similarly high regard. Despite the grim and depressing tone, “The Best Years of Our Lives” was the biggest box office success since 1939's “Gone With the Wind.” The picture was also one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1989.",
    "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly":
        "Julian Schnabel was best-known as an acclaimed painter before he transitioned into film, resulting in this French biographical drama. It tells the true story of magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffers from “locked-in syndrome.” Interweaving memory and reality, the movie glides along at its own unique and compelling pace. The movie was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Director and Best Film Editing.",
    "On the Waterfront":
        "“On the Waterfront” is a black and white crime drama starring Marlon Brando as Terry Malloy, a dockworker whose brother (Rod Steiger) works closely with their corrupted dockers' union boss (Lee J. Cobb). Throughout the movie, pressure builds as Malloy seeks to find his own footing and voice—and stand up to the crooked overlord. The film won eight Oscars and four Golden Globes. Additionally, the movie was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1989.",
    "Cool Hand Luke":
        "In this 1967 drama, Paul Newman plays a laid-back inmate in a rural prison, who routinely clashes with his overseers. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning George Kennedy the trophy for Best Supporting Actor. Ex-convict Donn Pearce authored the book upon which the film was based and co-wrote the screenplay. Despite his involvement, Pearce would later express disappointment in the finished product.",
    "Annie Hall":
        "Woody Allen is still cranking out new movies. But it’s1977’s “Annie Hall” that remains one of his most groundbreaking achievements, namely for its unconventional style. Allen breaks the fourth wall, incorporates animation, reads minds, time jumps, and employs a variety of comedic devices, all while telling a relatively simple love story. Not only was the movie influential as a work of art, but the title character (played by Diane Keaton) became something of a fashion icon. The United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992.",
    "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon":
        "Ang Lee returned to his Taiwanese roots to direct this Mandarin Chinese martial arts masterpiece, which follows two 19th-century warriors as they pursue a missing sword. One of the top-grossing foreign-language films of all time, it helped pave the way for a string of highbrow martial arts-themed movies. The film was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Original Score. A far less successful sequel debuted on Netflix in 2016.",
    "L.A. Confidential":
        "Adapted from James Ellroy's brilliant pulp novel, this 1997 crime drama takes place in 1950s Los Angeles and follows three police officers as they investigate a horrific murder. As the probe deepens, the officers come up against a tide of corruption, the source of which hits closer to home than they ever could have imagined. Included in the star-studded cast are Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell. The movie earned nine Academy Award nominations (including for Best Picture), winning two: Best Supporting Actress (Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay.",
    "The Social Network":
        "One of Harvard’s most anti-social misfits (played by Jesse Eisenberg) goes on to create the world’s most influential social platform in this blockbuster drama. While the story is more or less based on fact, it’s impossible to ignore screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s imprint in virtually every scene. That’s not to mention David Fincher’s dark cinematic style and the iconic score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, both of which infuse the story with palpably sinister overtones. “The Social Network” earned eight nominations at the Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Jesse Eisenberg, bringing home three trophies at the ceremony.",
    "No Country for Old Men":
        "Filmmaking duo the Coen brothers didn't let the dense prose of Cormac McCarthy inhibit them from faithfully adapting “No Country for Old Men.” In the 2007 film, a man (Josh Brolin) comes upon 2 million in missing drug money and soon finds himself being hunted by a ruthless killer (Javier Bardem). For the most part, the movie stays true to the source material, while terrific performances bring every character even further to life. “No Country for Old Men” won four Oscars at the 80th Academy Awards, including Best Picture.",
    "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind":
        "All the broken hearts out there can certainly relate to this surrealist film from director Michel Gondry and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman. It takes place in a society that seems quite similar to modern-day America, with perhaps a single exception: there's a medical procedure that will erase ex-lovers from one's memory. After Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet) suffer a bad breakup, they decide to undergo the procedure, only to discover that love still finds a way. The beloved film took home the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and earned Winslet a Best Actress Oscar nomination."
